To implement testing and reporting in your REST Assured Maven project following the modular design and externalized configuration principles, here is a clear and detailed guide on **where to create and what to create** for effective and maintainable test automation:

***

## 1. Where to Create Test Classes

- **Location:** All test classes should be created under the Maven standard test source folder:
  ```
  src/test/java/
  ```
  
- **Package Structure:** Mirror the main code package structure here to maintain clarity, modularity, and easy navigation. For example:

  - Authentication API tests:
    ```
    src/test/java/com/FlightBookingSystem/Authentication/
    ```
    
  - Passenger Service API tests:
    ```
    src/test/java/com/FlightBookingSystem/PassengerService/
    ```

- **Utilities for Testing:** Shared test utilities like custom assertion helpers or data providers should be placed under:
  ```
  src/test/java/com/FlightBookingSystem/utils/
  ```

***

## 2. What to Create in the Test Packages

### a. Test Classes

- **Authentication Tests**
  - Create classes such as `AuthenticationTests.java` or `TokenManagerTests.java`.
  - Responsibilities:
    - Verify token generation is successful.
    - Validate response status codes, token presence, and token expiry handling.

- **Passenger Service Tests**
  - Create classes such as `PassengerServiceTests.java`.
  - Responsibilities:
    - Test each Passenger API endpoint: add passenger, view passenger details, list passengers, search by name/mobile, and deletion.
    - Include both positive and negative test scenarios.
    - Use data-driven testing methods like TestNG Data Providers for varied input coverage.
  
***

### b. Test Methods

- Each test class will contain multiple test methods to cover various cases:
  
  - Status code verification (e.g., `assertEquals(response.statusCode(), 200)`)
  - Response content validation (e.g., checking returned data fields)
  - Error handling and boundary conditions
  - Authentication-related validations (valid and expired tokens)

***

### c. Test Data Management

- Use parameterization or externalize test data using:
  - TestNG Data Providers in the test classes
  - External JSON or properties files placed under:
    ```
    src/test/resources/
    ```
  - This promotes code reusability and easier maintenance.

***

## 3. Logging Integration

- Create or configure **logging utilities** under:
  ```
  src/main/java/com/FlightBookingSystem/utils/
  ```
- Use a logging framework like **Log4j2** or **SLF4J** to capture details of requests and responses during test execution.
- Configure log files to be stored in a dedicated folder (e.g., `/logs`) outside source code.

***

## 4. Test Reporting Setup

- Integrate a reporting framework such as:

  - **ExtentReports** or **Allure** for rich, interactive test execution reports.

- Reporting configuration and initialization can be done in:

  ```
  src/test/java/com/FlightBookingSystem/utils/
  ```

  as `ReportManager.java` or similar.

- Reports should be generated to an output folder such as `/reports`.

- Typical files to add for reporting:
  - Setup classes that initialize report listeners for TestNG/JUnit.
  - Configuration files for report styling if applicable.

## 5. Summary of Key Directories and Files

| Type                 | Location / Package                                                     | Purpose                                              |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Test Classes**     | `src/test/java/com/FlightBookingSystem/Authentication/`              | Authentication API test scenarios                    |
|                      | `src/test/java/com/FlightBookingSystem/PassengerService/`            | Passenger API test scenarios                         |
| **Test Utilities**   | `src/test/java/com/FlightBookingSystem/utils/`                        | Test helpers like data providers, assertion utils   |
| **Test Resources**   | `src/test/resources/`                                                 | External test data files (JSON, properties)         |
| **Logging Utils**    | `src/main/java/com/FlightBookingSystem/utils/`                        | Log configuration and utilities                      |
| **Reports Output**   | `/reports/`                                                          | Generated test execution reports                      |
| **Logs Output**      | `/logs/`                                                             | Test execution logs                                  |
| **Config File**      | `src/main/resources/config.properties`                               | API endpoints, credentials (externalized configuration) |
